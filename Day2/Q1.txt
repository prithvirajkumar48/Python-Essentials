1. You all are Pilots, you want to land a plane safely, so altitude required for landing a plane is
1000ft, it it is less than tell pilot to land the plane, or it is more than that but less than 5000ft ask
the pilot to “come down to 1000ft”, else if it more than 5000ft ask the pilot to “go around and try
later”

ANS:

## Python Program to print the Altitude for safe landing of the Plane

alt = int(input("Enter the Altitude: "))
if (alt<=1000):
    print("Safe to Land")
elif (alt > 1000 or alt <= 5000):
    print("Come Down to 1000ft")
else:
    print("Turn Around")
